## Implemented Features

### Authentication & Connection
- [x] Google OAuth sign-in via Supabase Auth (no manual credential input fields)
- [x] Credentials (`projectId`, `anonKey`) loaded from `config.js` (`window.CHAT_VIEW_CONFIG`) or `localStorage`
- [x] **Multi-environment support** — `config.js` accepts an `environments` array; login card shows a named dropdown when 2+ environments are configured, hidden for single-env setups
- [x] Per-environment `allowedDomains` — each environment can restrict sign-in to different email domains
- [x] Credentials and selected environment index persisted in `localStorage` (`sb_project_id`, `sb_key`, `sb_selected_env`) across page reloads and OAuth redirects
- [x] Environment dropdown selection restored on page reload and after OAuth redirect
- [x] Session restored automatically on page load if a valid Supabase session exists
- [x] Optional domain restriction via `config.js` `allowedDomains` array — sign-out forced if domain not allowed
- [x] **User/admin roles** — every signed-in user must have a row in `chat_view_user_roles`; access denied (immediate sign-out) if no row exists
- [x] **Auth bypass prevention** — `fetchOrCreateUserRole()` is called before the chat panel is shown; removed users can no longer access the app
- [x] Connection test with 10-second timeout before switching to chat view
- [x] Clear error messages for failed connections (timeout, bad credentials, RLS, domain restriction)
- [x] Logout button clears auth session, selected environment, and returns to login screen
- [x] Login card shows the Google sign-in button, an error area, and the optional environment selector (no credential fields, no status log)

### Navigation & Header
- [x] Permanent chat header bar (`#chat-header-bar`) outside `#chat-main`, always visible after login
- [x] Right side of chat header: Refresh button — always present
- [x] Left side of chat header (`#chat-session-controls`): session-specific controls populated when a session is selected:
  - Mark Reviewed / Reviewed ✓ toggle button
  - Feedback button
  - Session ID
  - Total message count
  - Type-count pills (human / ai / tool / system)
- [x] **Burger menu** (☰) in sidebar header with dropdown containing:
  - Signed-in user email and role badge (Admin / User)
  - Users item — opens admin settings modal
  - Invite item (visible to admins only) — opens admin settings modal
  - Logout — signs out and returns to login screen
- [x] Pulsing `• Live` badge shown next to burger menu in sidebar header

### Session List
- [x] **Lazy-loading architecture** — default load: 50 most recent sessions via `get_session_list` RPC (two-stage: fast GROUP BY for IDs, then JSONB metadata extraction)
- [x] **Infinite scroll** — scrolling to the bottom of the session list loads 10 more sessions per batch
- [x] Sessions grouped by `session_id`, sorted by selected sort order
- [x] Each session shows: ID, total message count, latest date, type-count pills, metadata badges
- [x] Type-count pills: human / ai / tool / system message counts per session
- [x] Metadata badges per session: request category, request type, `verified`, `end`, `reviewed` flags
- [x] Refresh button reloads sessions (respects active filters)
- [x] Realtime updates: new messages and sessions appear automatically via Supabase Realtime (INSERT events)
- [x] Pulsing `• Live` badge shown in sidebar header when Realtime channel is active (`SUBSCRIBED`)
- [x] Filters and sort order preserved across realtime updates and manual refreshes
- [x] **Time gate** — session info bar shows the time range (last-activity based) of currently loaded sessions
- [x] **Environment switcher** — dropdown in sidebar header allows switching environments without returning to login

### Mark as Reviewed
- [x] "Mark Reviewed" button in the chat header toggles reviewed state for the open session
- [x] Reviewed sessions show a `reviewed` badge in the session list
- [x] Reviewed state stored in `localStorage` (key `sb_reviewed_<projectId>`, persisted as JSON array)
- [x] Reviewed state loaded on init and on every refresh

### User Management (Admin)
- [x] Admin users see an **Invite** item in the burger menu dropdown (hidden for non-admins)
- [x] Users / Invite items open an admin settings modal showing the signed-in user's name and role
- [x] Admin can invite a new user by email and assign them a `user` or `admin` role
- [x] If the email already has a Supabase Auth account, only the role is updated (no duplicate invite sent)
- [x] Invite logic handled by `invite-user` Edge Function (admin-only, requires valid JWT + admin role check)

### Filtering & Search
- [x] **Server-side session ID search** — searches the entire `chat_messages` database via ILIKE; debounced at 400ms with "Searching..." indicator; returns up to 50 matches
- [x] **"Apply Filters" button** — server-side filters (date, tools, categories, request types, message count) applied on click via RPC
- [x] Date range filter (from/to) — max 3-day gap enforced with warning; auto-fills last 3 days if not specified
- [x] Message count filter (min/max), inclusive
- [x] Tools filter: multi-select dropdown+checklist, AND logic (session must use ALL selected tools)
- [x] Category filter: multi-select dropdown+checklist, OR logic (session matches any selected category)
- [x] Request type filter: multi-select dropdown+checklist, OR logic (session matches any selected type)
- [x] Reviewed filter: all / unreviewed only / reviewed only (client-side)
- [x] Sort: newest first, oldest first, most messages, fewest messages (client-side, on loaded sessions)
- [x] **Clear Filters** button resets all filter inputs and reloads default 50 sessions
- [x] Filter inputs persist after Apply (only cleared on Clear Filters)
- [x] Session count shown ("N sessions+" or "N sessions found" when filters active)
- [x] Collapsible filter panel (toggle open/closed)
- [x] Custom dropdown+checklist UI for tools, category, and request type:
  - Trigger button label updates to show count of selected items (e.g. "Tools (2)")
  - Clicking outside any open dropdown closes it; opening one closes the others
  - Checked state preserved when realtime updates rebuild dropdown options
- [x] Filter dropdown options populated from `get_filter_options` RPC (scoped to last 7 days)

### Message View
- [x] Messages loaded on session click, ordered by `created_at` ascending
- [x] Loading spinner while messages fetch
- [x] Messages scroll to bottom on load
- [x] Human (customer) messages: white left-aligned bubbles
- [x] AI final response messages: green right-aligned bubbles with metadata badges (category, type, verified, end)
- [x] AI tool-call messages: yellow center bubbles with collapsible args (`<details>`)
- [x] Tool result messages: yellow center bubbles with collapsible response (`<details>`)
- [x] System messages: compact centered pill-style bubbles
- [x] All message bubbles show formatted timestamp (Europe/Chisinau timezone)
- [x] Realtime: new messages appended live when the currently viewed session receives an INSERT
- [x] XSS protection: all database content passed through `escapeHtml()` before rendering

### Feedback System
- [x] Per-session feedback: "Feedback" button in chat header session controls
- [x] Per-message feedback: hover button (💬) on every message bubble
- [x] Feedback modal with category select (bug / suggestion / praise / other) and free-text comment
- [x] Feedback submitted to Supabase Edge Function (`chat-feedback`) with full message metadata, signed-in user email, and active environment name (`env` field)
- [x] Edge Function stores feedback in `chat_feedback` table (service role key bypasses RLS)
- [x] Edge Function optionally forwards feedback to n8n webhook (`VA_FEEDBACK_FORM_WEBHOOK`)
- [x] Success/error status shown in modal after submission
- [x] Modal closes automatically 1.5s after successful submission
- [x] Click outside modal to cancel

### Visitor Settings Integration
- [x] **Session enrichment** — `get_session_list` LEFT JOINs `visitors_settings` (via `session_id`) to enrich sessions with project, visitor type, language, validation, WhatsApp channel, lead/case/booking presence, request ID, and masked phone
- [x] **Visitor badges in session list** — project (indigo), visitor type (pink), language (lime), WhatsApp (teal), validated (teal), lead/case/booking entity (purple)
- [x] **Visitor info in chat header** — project, type, language, WhatsApp, validation, lead/case/booking, phone, request ID shown as badges when session is selected
- [x] **Visitor settings filters** — server-side filters for project, visitor type, language (multi-select dropdown checklists, OR logic), validation, WhatsApp (boolean select), has lead/case/booking (boolean select)
- [x] **Filter options populated from `get_filter_options`** — projects, visitor types, languages scoped to last 7 days

### UI / UX
- [x] WhatsApp-inspired design with CSS custom properties for theming
- [x] CSS design tokens: shadow scale (`--shadow-sm` to `--shadow-xl`), radius scale (`--radius-sm` to `--radius-full`), z-index layers (`--z-sidebar` to `--z-modal`)
- [x] Responsive layout: sidebar overlays at ≤768px
- [x] Collapsible tool call / tool result details (`<details>` element)
- [x] Cache-busting query param on `app.js` (`?v=43`) — increment when deploying
- [x] Loading overlay during session load and filter apply
- [x] "Searching..." indicator in session list during server-side search
- [x] **Empty states** — "No sessions found" or "No sessions match your filters" with Clear Filters action link
- [x] **Copy session ID** — click session ID in chat header to copy to clipboard; visual "Copied!" feedback
- [x] **Shareable session URLs** — `?session=<id>` URL param; auto-selects session on load; updated via `history.replaceState`
- [x] **Session ID overflow** — long session IDs truncated with ellipsis in sidebar
- [x] Global JS error handler shows errors in the browser console
- [x] CDN load error handler for Supabase library (error shown in `#login-error`)

### Accessibility (WCAG AA)
- [x] **Color contrast** — `--text-secondary` and `--system-color` darkened for AA compliance; `.type-pill.human` text darkened
- [x] **Focus-visible states** — all buttons, inputs, selects, and tabbable elements show `outline: 2px solid var(--accent)` on keyboard focus
- [x] **Reduced motion** — `prefers-reduced-motion` media query disables all animations and transitions
- [x] **ARIA attributes** — `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby` on all modals; `aria-label` on burger menu, refresh button; `aria-live="polite"` on session count
- [x] **Keyboard navigation** — Escape closes all modals and dropdowns; arrow keys navigate session list; session items are tabbable (`tabIndex=0`)

### Performance
- [x] **DocumentFragment rendering** — session list built via `DocumentFragment` for single DOM append instead of N individual mutations
- [x] **Tabbable session items** — `tabIndex=0` + `data-session-id` on each `<li>` for keyboard navigation

## Todo

### High Priority
- [ ] **Configurable timezone** — currently hardcoded to `Europe/Chisinau`; let user pick from a dropdown or detect from browser (`Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`)
- [ ] **Filter by verified / end-conversation flags** — two boolean session properties visible as badges but not yet exposed as filter options

### Low Priority / Nice to Have
- [ ] **Export** — download a session's messages as JSON or plain text
- [ ] **Session notes** — let users add a private text note to a session, stored in localStorage alongside reviewed state
- [ ] **Dark mode** — CSS variables are dark-mode ready; add `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query or toggle
- [ ] **Event delegation for message feedback buttons** — replace per-message listeners with single delegated listener on `#chat-main`
